# Web_Scraping_Sentiment_Analysis

This project includes the process of web scraping IMDb movie reviews, data preprocessing and sentiment analysis with Python. 

The steps involved in a web scraping and sentiment analysis machine learning project are:

1. Data Collection: Collect the data from the desired websites or web pages using web scraping techniques.

2. Data Cleaning: Clean the collected data by removing irrelevant information, converting text to lowercase, and removing stop words and punctuations.

3. Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on the cleaned data to determine the sentiment of each text or review. This can be done using various techniques such as lexicon-based methods, rule-based methods, and machine learning-based methods.

4. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the text data that will be used as input for the machine learning model. This could include word frequencies, n-grams, part of speech tags, etc.

5. Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the extracted features to predict the sentiment of new reviews. This could be a supervised learning task, such as using a decision tree, random forest, or a deep learning model like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
